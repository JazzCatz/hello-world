# hello-world
I'm Jazz Catz, a computer gamer and web designer/amateur programmer. I learned HTML/web design back in 1999, VisualBasic.NET back in the early 2000's and have been gaming my whole life. I am on here to troubleshoot some Minecraft plugins and possibly develop and publish my own.
Thats about it!  See ya's around.
